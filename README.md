## About GitWiki

GitWiki is an open source project where all are invited to collaborate to write articles about different topics related to git.
Everything is to be written in markdown. If you aren't very familiar with markdown, [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) has helpful resources for learning formatting with markdown.

## Current Sections

Currently have the following sections:

[Branches](./branches.md)

[Commit](./commit.md) (draft)

## Contribution

If you would like to contribute: please check out [Contribution](./contribution.md) for detailed information.

For new sections, it's suggested to use the provided [template](./template.md) as a guide.

If you want to work on something that there isn't an issue for, please [add a new issue](https://github.com/larkceresin/GitWiki/issues/new) so we can make sure we don't have multiple people working on the same thing (outside of pair/mob programming sessions)
