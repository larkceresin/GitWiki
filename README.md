# GitWiki

Working on creating a wiki about all things related to git.

This will be written fully in markdown.

Currently have the following sections:

[Branches](./branches.md)

If you would like to contribute: Please check out [Contribution](./contribution.md) for detailed information.
If you want to work on something that there isn't an issue for, please [add a new issue](https://github.com/larkceresin/GitWiki/issues/new) so we can make sure we don't have multiple people working on the same thing (outside of pair/mob programming sessions)
